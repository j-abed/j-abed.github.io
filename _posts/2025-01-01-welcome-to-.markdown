🌟 **Welcome to My Blog!** 🌟  
If you’re here, chances are you share my fascination with the intersection of **business and technology**—two worlds that are converging faster than ever in today’s digital age.

This space is dedicated to exploring how we can better integrate business strategy with advanced technologies to drive real value. Whether you’re a business leader, a student, or a tech enthusiast, my goal is to simplify complex topics, share practical insights, and inspire conversations about what’s possible when these domains truly come together.

## **About Me**
👔 **Hi, I’m Jason Abed.**  
I’ve spent the past 15 years working in **big tech** (Microsoft) and **consulting**, where I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with clients across industries like **retail, financial services, professional services**, and the **public sector** (government, education, and nonprofit). Most recently, I partnered with **The Met Museum** in New York on a transformative project.

While my educational background in **finance and strategy** initially prepared me for the business world, I always expected my career at Microsoft to revolve around technical skills. Interestingly, it was my **business knowledge and acumen** that first accelerated my career, enabling me to thrive in roles at the intersection of strategy and technology.

## **Why I Started This Blog**

💡 **Inspiration**  
The idea for this blog came from working with **summer interns at Microsoft** and **current MBA candidates at NYU Stern** (where I’m an alum). Both groups had access to a wealth of resources on either business or technology—but very few that effectively merged the two.

I realized that the gap between **strategy** and **execution** is a common challenge. Many professionals are still figuring out how to align technological investments with business outcomes or translate high-level strategies into impactful solutions. This blog is my way of addressing that challenge and helping others navigate it.
